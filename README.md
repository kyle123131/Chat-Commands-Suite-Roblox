READ Use.Md to see how to create commands


The code isnt my finest work. but, its gets the job done, of course this is open source.

-- Version: 0.1 (outdated check releases)

Version Notes:
0.1: Project Start

1.0: Fully functional

1.1: Removed the auto_ function (previously added creator UserIds to the allowed table when it was Nil)
     - Buggy,
     - Difficult and not working properly
May be added back later
